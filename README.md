# GTK Planner

A planner inspired by [elementary planner](https://github.com/alainm23/planner), but written in C++ using GTK.

Currently this project is very work in progress, but the goal is to make a planner that better integrates with the linux desktop while still maintaining a safe level of minimalism as to not overwhelm new users like many planners have for me. The future goal is to provide Kanban style project management as well as the ability to sync with a personal server or some public alternative like Google Drive, Dropbox, or something similar. These features will most likely be added far later once a stable planner is produced.
